        <strong>cocktail</strong>
        <p id="strong--cocktail">
          Definition : an appetizer served as a first course at a meal The
          "appetizer" meaning of cocktail. is connected to the "drink" use.
          During the 19th century, cocktail began to be used for something
          resembling the drink as a mixture of diverse elements or
          ingredients—as small pieces of food with. a sauce or seasoning.
          Familiar examples are "fruit cocktail" and "shrimp cocktail." Both of
          which can be served cold as an

        <strong>Relish</strong>
        <p>
          Definition : appetizer, hors d'oeuvre Relish is an alteration of
          Middle English reles, meaning "taste." The word is occasionally
          encountered to indicate enjoyment in something that satisfies one's
          tastes—for example, "The hungry teenagers ate with great relish" or
          "The villain took relish in explaining his fiendish plan." However,
          relish is most familiar as a word for something adding a zestful
          flavor, like the food condiment made of chopped pickles. This
          flavorful sense of relish influenced its use for a savory appetizer.

        <strong>Pupu</strong>
        <p>
          Definition : an Asian dish served as an appetizer or main course and
          consisting of a variety of foods (such as egg rolls, spareribs, and
          fried shrimp) Pupu is a borrowing of Hawaiian pūpū, meaning
          "appetizer." The "pupu platter" is a common offering on American
          Chinese and Hawaiian menus and usually consists of such items as egg
          rolls, spareribs, fried shrimp, and chicken. We recommend ordering
          this appetizer for two or more ... or as a meal for one.

      <li>
        <strong>Whet</strong>
        <p>
          Definition : appetizer; also : a drink of liquor Whet goes back to Old
          English as a verb referring to sharpening or putting a sharp edge or
          point on an object. The noun form appears in the 17th century for
          things that literally sharpen, or that figuratively sharpen by
          inciting or stimulating. A whet of food or drink to stimulate the
          desire to eat is always appreciated, and not to be passed over.

    <h2>Main Courses</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Honey-Garlic Chicken</strong>

        <p>
          Honey and garlic are always a dynamic duo, especially when used to
          create a flavor-packed sauce for chicken thighs. We like serving this
          main dish over mashed potatoes with Bacon-Balsamic Brussels Sprouts on
          the side.
        </p>
      </li>

        <strong>Bourbon Chicken</strong>
        <p>
          This chicken dinner comes together in just 25 minutes, which is most
          likely even faster than takeout. Serve over steamed rice and garnish
          with fresh scallions.

        <strong>Jam doughnut pancakes</strong>

          festival of light, in December. It’s traditional to eat fried foods
          during the celebrations
